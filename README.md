# u4-extractor

A simple command-line tool that extracts images from Ultima IV's game files.

## How to Use

`u4-extractor {path-to-ultima-iv} [output-directory-for-tiles]`

## What it Does

For now, it doesn't do much. It just extracts the tiles from shapes.ega, creating a file per tile. See `To-Do` for what else I plan to do with it.

## To-Do

- create a spritesheet from the shapes.ega tiles
- extract the dungeon art

If you want me to add something else to this, please [create an issue](https://github.com/half-ogre/u4-extractor/issues/new).
